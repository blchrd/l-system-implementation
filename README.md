# L-System implementation

This repo contains a simple implementation in Rust of [L-System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) to generate images.

## Usage

```
cargo install
cargo run -- [-f filepath]
```

The rendering part can be a little long if you want a high number of iteration

You have sample file in the `sample` folder.

For now, the rendered image will be in the `render` folder.
